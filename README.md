## SQL Employee Tracker

## Description
This is a Node-based employee management app that utilizes MySQL2. This app allows the user to view all employees, the org chart based on dept, add and delete employees, update roles for existing employee. This app is unable to be deployed as it strictly a back-end application, a walkthrough video of the app is at the bottom of this README. 

## Technology Used
Node, MySql2

## Usage
Users will need to run npm install upon opening repo locally to install all dependencies. They will then need to log into MySql and run the schema and the seeds to set up the initial database. From there, they will type node index.js into the integrated terminal to launch the program. This program is very simple- using the up and down arrow and enter keys to navigate and select options. When an option is selected, the appropriate prompts or data will appear with the menu reloading underneath. When done, the user simply navigates to the exit option, which will end their session.
